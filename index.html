       Hi, I'm Darcey! Originally hailing from the great state of Wisconsin, I've basically grown up in Charlotte, NC. I attended the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and majored in History and Geography. I have a background in GIS, and will absolutely freak out over a well designed map.</p>
    <p class= "writing">I am currently back at school at UNC-Charlotte to study full stack web development. I am excited for this challenge and the opportunity to change careers.</p>
    <p class= "writing">In my free time, I enjoy skiing, sporting clays, reading, traveling and spending time with my family.</p>
    <p class= "writing">My favorite quote from Winston Churchill is: </p>
        <p class= "quote"> <i>"We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give."</i></p>
